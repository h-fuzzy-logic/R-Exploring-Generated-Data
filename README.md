# R-Exploring-Generated-Data

This repo uses R in a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate:
* Generating data so that the "truth" is known
* Creating poor, good, and perfect linear regression models
* Exploring the model summaries, diagnostics, and error calculations

Note: All data is generated in the notebook.  No data files are needed.
